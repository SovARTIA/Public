# SOVEREIGNTY ARTIA README/DISCLAIMER

Sovereignty A.R.T.I.A. (Access Retention Transmission Interception Acquisition) is a decentralized platform for personal and business users to facilitate their digital sovereignty. Users will do this by utilizing the resources found in this repository according to their own use cases and threat models.

This repository contains resources, tools, and projects related to cybersecurity and digital sovereignty. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or attacks. Digital sovereignty is the ability of individuals and communities to control their own digital assets and identities.

## Motivation
